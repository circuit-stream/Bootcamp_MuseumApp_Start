  title: Women of Algiers
  author: "Eug\xE8ne Delacroix"
  description: "Women of Algiers in their Apartment is the title of two oil on canvas
    paintings by the French Romantic painter Eug\xE8ne Delacroix. The two works both
    depict the same scene of four women together in an enclosed room. Despite the
    similar setting, the two paintings evoke completely different moods through the
    depiction of the women."
